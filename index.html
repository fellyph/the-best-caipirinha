            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Caipirinha is Brazil's national cocktail, made with cachaça (sugarcane hard liquor), sugar, and lime.[2] Cachaça, also known as caninha, or any one of a multitude of traditional names, is Brazil's most common distilled alcoholic beverage. Although both rum and cachaça are made from sugarcane-derived products, in cachaça the alcohol results from the fermentation of fresh sugarcane juice that is then distilled, while rum is usually made from refinery by-products such as molasses.[3]

            <p>
                The drink is prepared by mixing the fruit and the sugar together, and adding the liquor. This can be made into a single glass, usually large, that can be shared amongst people, or into a larger jar, from which it is served in individual glasses.
